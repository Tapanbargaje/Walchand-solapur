                    Dear Students, <br/> <br/>

                    It gives me great pleasure to see the good things happening in our department right from its
                    inception. We have started in 1998 with great enthusiasm and coordination from students, faculty and
                    staff to enrich our department as it is today. We have experienced good happenings starting with our
                    faculty enriching themselves in educational qualifications and acquiring knowledge and disseminating
                    it as resource personnel’s at seminars, workshops and conferences. Their research publications are
                    also remarkable. Our students are always exhibiting their competitive nature showing almost 100%
                    results every year at final year level with bagging almost all the top ranks at the university.
                    Conduction of various programs by the students association (CSI) and the department have helped to
                    build complete personalities among students ready to face Technical and Social problems. Our
                    students also excel in co curricular and extracurricular activities in their representations at
                    national and International levels. <br/> <br/>

                    Placements are always 100% for eligible candidate’s right from inception at well reputed M.N.C’s.
                    Our laboratory staff constantly updates themselves to match with the changing times of technology.
                    Our Infrastructure matched the need of the syllabus and industry. We have a high speed internet
                    facility with excellent bandwidth supported by internet, Wi-Fi and all other hardware and software
                    requirements. We have a strong tie with industry through MOU’s and Indo U.S collaboration for
                    engineering education. <br /> <br />

                    We have started using modern techniques like ‘Active Teaching‘ to generate more interactive teaching
                    sessions.We have collaborated with companies like INFOSYS, TCS and RBTech Services to offer
                    industrial electives like Mobile Application Development and Business Intelligence. The competitions
                    at faculty level and student level have taken a great boom in our student and faculty. Various
                    remedial classes and sessions are conducted for the benefit of weaker students. Our Alumni
                    constantly support our department with their valuable advice, guest lectures and encouragement. A
                    lot of contribution of our students and Faculty toeards Innovation Entrepreneurship tart up and IPR
                    wareness is seen towards Institutions Innovation Council (IIC) of our institute. <br/> <br/>
                    I end my short account now by requesting all the students, faculty and staff of the department to
                    show the same enthusiasm they have shown in the past to see that the future of the department is
                    also bright one. With warm regards and best wishes for the future. <br/> <br/>
