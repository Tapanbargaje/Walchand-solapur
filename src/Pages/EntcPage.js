                    Dear Students, <br /> <br />

                    Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering is a variegated and ever-evolving branch. Innovation,
                    orientation, and an ever-expanding base serve as a firm foundation for the edifice for the latest
                    development in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering. This is imparting the required technical
                    and practical knowledge to the students with well-equipped laboratories so as to give practical
                    hands-on experience to our students. The equipment available in the labs are upgraded as an ongoing
                    process so as to keep pace with the latest developments in the field of Electronics &
                    Telecommunication Engineering. An effort is made to groom these students not only to become
                    successful Electronics & Telecommunication Engineers but also top-notch professionals. This
                    Programme makes ceaseless efforts to aggrandize the knowledge of the faculty regularly by arranging
                    seminars and a variety of Faculty development programs and skill enhancement programs through
                    various industry training. <br/> <br/>

                        The latest upgradation in the faculty members is disseminated for the enhancement of the student’s
                        knowledge. Lectures on Personality Development, ethics, confidence building, and conduct of group
                        discussions by senior faculty along with the online certification courses in multidisciplinary
                        domain conducted by NPTEL under the mentorship of our faculties, help our students to develop
                        themselves into confident professionals so as to prove to be an asset to any organization they
                        choose to work with. <br /> <br />

                                The Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering Programme of Walchand Institute of Technology
                                was established in the year 1999 with an intake of 40 seats. In 2002, the intake was increased
                                to 60 seats while in 2010, the total intake of 120 seats was sanctioned. With the rapid
                                advancement of the computer age and cybernetics, the boundaries between different branches of
                                engineering have been steadily diminishing, particularly in the realm of “soft” engineering
                                branches such as ‘ Electronics ‘, ‘ Electronics & Telecommunication ‘ and ‘ Computer Science &
                                Engineering ‘. Electronics along with the Telecommunication sector has pervaded every aspect of
                                human life, vastly expanding its scope, particularly in conjunction with computer applications.
                                Recognizing the potential of these changes and aiming to provide aspiring engineers with the
                                chance to build successful careers in the fields of Electronics, Communication, and Computer
                                Science Engineering, the Programme started Honors degrees in “Internet of Things”, “Data
                                Science”, and “Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning” thereby imbibing globally recognized
                                skills in the students. It has grown over the years into a competent wing with state-of-the-art
                                computing facilities, well-equipped laboratories, and dedicated faculty. The Programme is a
                                recognized research center under Punyashlok Ahilyadevi Holkar Solapur University, Solapur. The
                                Programme has continuously upgraded the infrastructure according to changing needs of the
                                technological environment. <br /> <br />
                                The Programme has twelve major laboratories, viz., Audio and Video Engg. Lab, Microwave Engg.,
                                Analog and Digital Communication, Internet of Things Signal Processing, Optical Communication,
                                Microprocessor and Microcontroller, Basic Electronics, Computer Lab, Control System, Programming
                                Lab. The Programme plays a vital role in driving innovation and technological advancements,
                                providing solutions for various industries, and meeting the market’s demand for advanced
                                electronic systems and communication networks. It encompasses the study of electronic devices
                                and circuits, analysis and design of analog and digital circuits, electronic systems,
                                communication technology and systems along with artificial intelligence, machine learning, data
                                science, and programming skills. These skills are enhanced through a combination of theoretical
                                learning and practical sessions conducted in well-equipped laboratories with the aid of software
                                tools adhering to the industry readiness of the students. <br /> <br />

                                Also, the availability of highly qualified, experienced faculty and good infrastructure
                                facilities, sculpt the Programme to grab the merit among the top ranks of the Solapur University
                                affiliated colleges. To enhance the technical skill as well as for the overall development of
                                the students, various student cells in the institute such as CSI, ISTE, IEI, etc., the
                                department, and student’s association TESA (Telecommunication and Electronics Students
                                Association) continuously conducts the programs such as programming contests, Domain Specific
                                Placement Activity, Hackathons, Industry collaborated internships, seminars, and workshops on
                                various state of art technologies and personality development which in turn increased the number
                                of participants and prize-winning of the students in various activities at the National and
                                International level. <br /> <br />

                                Good interaction with the industries is maintained so that the students also have better
                                exposure to the professional environment and its needs. This also helps in bridging the gap
                                between the academics and Industry requirements so that our students get preference in the
                                Industrial arena. The faculties and students are encouraged to present and publish their
                                research work at various National and International level conferences regularly, and also
                                undergo training or internship in reputed industries such as HAL, DRDO, Precision Camshaft,
                                Tejas Networks, etc. Projects are carried out in various areas of Communication, Electronics
                                Engg., Software, Embedded Systems, AIML, Internet of Things, etc. Most of them are sponsored by
                                industry. Nearly 90% of the final year students are placed in multinational companies like
                                Intel, Qualcomm, Samsung, Synopsis, Infosys, Wipro, HCL Technologies, Solutions, TCS, Tech
                                Mahindra, Cognizant, PSPL, KPIT Cummins, L & T, Virtusa, Zensar, etc. Large galaxies of students
                                are working abroad. <br /> <br />
