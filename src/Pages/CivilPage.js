                    It gives me immense pleasure to introduce our Civil Engineering Department which is one of the
                    oldest Departmentof the Institute. The Strength of our department is excellent Laboratories equipped
                    withstate-of-the-art infrastructure, qualified and experienced faculty having expertise in diverse
                    fields, and excellent Industry Institute interactionin the form of consultancy services, training,
                    sponsored projects, joint research work, etc. As a result of this, The Department has received the
                    AICTE-CII award of ‘Best Industry Linked Institute in Civil Engineering’ for three years i.e. 2013,
                    2014, and 2018. <br /> <br />

                    The Department is accredited four times by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) New Delhi.
                    Department has signed MOU with reputed organizations Like the National Highway Authority of India
                    (NHAI), Progressive Engineering Consultants, Maheshwari Contro Solutions,etc.for joint research,
                    training, internship, and placement of students. <br /> <br />

                    Department has received funds of @ 1.2 crores from AICTE and other agencies under various schemes
                    like the Research Promotion Scheme (RPS), Modernization and removal of obsolesce (MODROBS),
                    University seed money, etc.which enable us to develop excellent research laboratories. <br /> <br />



                    The Department is rendering Consultancy services in the various domain of CivilEngineeringlike
                    Geotechnical Engineering, Transportation Engineering, Surveying, Concrete Technology, and
                    Environmental Engineering along with Proof consultancy services for the analysis and design of civil
                    Engineering structures. We also undertake Third Party Technical Audit of several civil engineering
                    works executed by PWD, SMC, Nagar Parishad, etc.This helps us to give more practical knowledge to
                    the students with an encouragementto takeindustry-sponsored projectsand several Industrial visits
                    which enhance student learning. <br /> <br />
