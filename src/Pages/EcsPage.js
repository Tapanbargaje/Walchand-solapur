                    The Electronics Engineering Department was established in 1983. Since then the department was
                    running a U.G. course of Electronics Engineering. Department has started a PG course in Electronics
                    Engineering from 2009-10. Research laboratory under the Department is recognized for Doctoral
                    Research. <br/> <br/>

                    The key to surviving this new industrial revolution is leading it. That requires two key elements of
                    agile education ecosystem: awareness of disruptive technology and a plan to develop talent that can
                    be accepted by industry immediately after graduation. WIT has long back anticipated the emerging
                    technological changes and has started capacity building in terms of development of infrastructure,
                    human resource (especially teachers) and curriculum. Department holds dedicated and motivated
                    faculty with research aptitude in the promising tech fields. The curriculum delivered at department
                    is innovative, continuously updated and embrace the skill and knowledge requisite of the students to
                    face upcoming technological challenges with consideration for society and environment. <br/> <br/>

                    With the evolution of computer age first and then cybernetics, the walls between various branches of
                    engineering are diminishing, especially between ‘soft’ branches of engineering like Electronics and
                    Computer Science & Engineering. Electronics has crept into every sphere of human life, thus
                    increasing its scope manifolds especially overlapping with computer applications. In order to
                    leverage these changes and to provide the budding engineers an opportunity to make a successful
                    career in Electronics and Computer fields, Department renewed undergraduate program in ‘Electronics
                    Engineering’ into ‘Electronics and Computer Engineering’ from 2021-22. Both Electronics and
                    Computers are unquestionably promising growth-driven domains and their blend into a single program
                    will enable students to avail a wide range of job opportunities. <br /> <br />

                        in ‘Electronics Engineering’ into ‘Electronics and Computer Engineering’ from 2021-22. <br/> <br/>

                        Both Electronics and Computers are unquestionably promising growth-driven domains and their
                        blend into a single program will enable students to avail a wide range of job opportunities.
                        Some of the most significant new-age career choices that students can select after their degree
                        are – <br/> <br/>

                        1.  Electronics Design Engineer – Typically responsible for creating, designing and producing
                        everyday devices like mobile phones, music devices, and computers, electronics engineers
                        innovate and develop new ideas in a wide range of industries. They design and manage equipment
                        used to control and monitor processes, systems, and machinery in diverse areas. <br/> <br/>
                        2.  Industry 4.0 Opportunities – The current transformation of the industry toward digitization is
                        in full swing. More and more industries are now adopting Internet of Things, smart factory, or
                        cyber physical (production) systems. Industry 4.0 encompasses everything from the Internet of
                        Things and machine learning to smart manufacturing robots. The back bone of industry 4.0 are the
                        smart sensors and circuits which are essentially designed, deployed and maintained by
                        Electronics Engineers <br/> <br/>
                        3.  IoT and Big Data Challenge- Presently Internet of Things (IoT) use cases span a wide swath of
                        uses and sectors, from agriculture to smart devices to machinery. Sensors are used for asset
                        management, fleet tracking, remote health monitoring, and more IoT focused Electronics Engineers
                        are creating platforms, software and applications that enterprises and organizations can use to
                        manage their IoT devices and the data generated. These tools created for big data and analytics
                        are useful for corralling the influx of data streaming in from IoT devices. <br/> <br/>
                        4.  Cyber-Physical Systems, Data Analytics and Machine Learning Applications – Rapid developments in
                        hardware, software, and communication technologies have facilitated the emergence of cyber
                        physical systems which generates huge data characterized by its velocity in terms of time and
                        location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent
                        processing and analysis of this data using Machine Learning paradigms is the key for running
                        successful real time applications. Electronics engineers are playing a vital role in designing
                        and developing these applications. <br/> <br/>
                        Programmer in IT – This career option of developing programs in a variety of computer languages,
                        such as C, C++, Java and Python is ever growing. With sound foundation of programming skills and
                        logical abilities, Electronics engineers are the strong contenders for such jobs. <br/> <br/>
                        Being conscious about the new age career paths, department has designed and deployed an all
                        embracing framework to make students immediate ready after graduation to walk on these career
                        paths. Modern programming languages like C, C++, Java, MATLAB and Python are part of the regular
                        curriculum. Contemporary technologies like IOT, Machine Learning and Data Analytics also find a
                        place in curriculum. Students are trained for competitive programming competitions which are now
                        becoming doors to IT industries. The indispensable soft skills like aptitude and communication
                        are also nurtured through extra coaching. The self learning ability of the students is fostered
                        by motivating them to undertake various MOOC courses like Coursera and NPTEL. The project based
                        learning component is brought in by undertaking industry collaborated student project on
                        societal applications and real life issues. <br/> <br/>

                        The soft and technical skills of the students are nurtured through seminars, project works,
                        industrial visit and technical paper presentation on state of the art technologies. Department
                        enjoys sound rapport with industry through consultancy projects, sponsored projects and research
                        ventures. Department has below sponsored labs / hardware by leading industrial hubs across
                        globe- 1. ACTEL, USA – VLSI Hardware and derivative software 2. Texas Instruments- PANDA boards
                        for mobile applications development 3. Cypress Semiconductors- PSoC boards and derivative
